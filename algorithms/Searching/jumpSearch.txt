Algorithm
1. Find the block size to be jumped.
2. Find the block where the element is present. (if present)
3. Do the linear search for the target in the block where target could be present.
4. If we reached next block or the end of the array, element is not present.
5. If element is found, return the index.
6. Else return -1.
